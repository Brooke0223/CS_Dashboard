# Michigan Controlled Substance Dashboard


## Description

The "Michigan Controlled Substance Dashboard" is a data science project aimed at creating an insightful Power BI dashboard that presents key insights into Controlled Substance Prescribing Practices in the state of Michigan. This project leverages expansive and publicly-accessible datasets to construct an engaging visualization tool that facilitates the understanding of controlled substance prescription patterns.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Data Analysis**: Utilize data science techniques to analyze and extract meaningful insights from extensive datasets related to controlled substance prescriptions in Michigan.
- **Data Wrangling**: Apply data wrangling techniques to clean, preprocess, and transform raw data into a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Design and implement an efficient ETL pipeline to manage the flow of data from various sources to the final dashboard.
- **Visualization**: Create an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents the analyzed data in a visually appealing and understandable manner.
- **Educational Integration**: Offer a valuable learning opportunity for students by potentially integrating the project's content into Oregon State University's CS-340 course, providing practical experience in data science techniques and database concepts.
- **User-Focused Tool**: Develop a dashboard that holds promising potential for use by healthcare providers, legislators, public health organizations, and anyone interested in understanding controlled substance prescribing trends.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations that enable users to explore controlled substance prescribing practices over time.
- Comparative analysis of different types of controlled substances and their prescription patterns.
- Geospatial visualizations showcasing prescription hotspots across different regions in Michigan.
- Trends analysis to identify potential shifts in prescribing practices and their implications.
- User-friendly interface that allows users to customize and filter data according to their specific interests.
- Integration potential with educational curricula for a hands-on learning experience.


## Datasets

The project utilizes publicly-accessible datasets. 
- Controlled Substance Data: Prescription data draws upon Michigan's Annual Drug Utilization Reports. Datasets are available for download [here](https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/bpl/health/maps/reports).
- Population Estimates: Population estimates draw upon comprehensive data sourced from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Datasets are available for download [here](https://vitalstats.michigan.gov/osr/Population/npPopAgeGroupSlider.asp?AreaType=C).
